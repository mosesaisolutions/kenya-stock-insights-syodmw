You want to build a Kenyan stock tracking app that provides insights on buy, sell, or accumulate recommendations based on company performance and political/economic indicators. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Stock Tracking:** A screen displaying a list of Kenyan stocks with key information like price, change, and a simple performance indicator (e.g., up/down arrow).\n*   **Stock Detail View:** A detailed view for each stock, including historical price data (a simple chart), company information, and the \"buy/sell/accumulate\" recommendation.\n*   **News & Indicators:** A section displaying relevant news articles, political events, and economic indicators that might influence stock performance.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#f9f9f9` (Light gray for a clean look)\n    *   Text: `#2e2e2e` (Dark gray for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#717171` (Medium gray for less important text)\n    *   Primary: `#007bff` (A classic blue for interactive elements)\n    *   Secondary: `#6c757d` (A softer gray for accents)\n    *   Accent: `#28a745` (Green for positive indicators)\n    *   Card: `#ffffff` (White for content containers)\n    *   Highlight: `#ffc107` (Yellow for important highlights)\n*   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" (default) or \"Roboto\" for a professional feel.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Create the Stock List Screen:** Modify the `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` file to display a list of Kenyan stocks. This will involve:\n    *   Replacing the existing demo content with a basic stock list.\n    *   Fetching (or mocking) stock data (name, price, change) and displaying it in a `FlatList`.\n    *   Adding navigation to the stock detail view when a stock is pressed.\n2.  **Create the Stock Detail Screen:** Create a new file, possibly `app/(tabs)/(home)/[stockId].tsx`, to display detailed information for a selected stock. This will involve:\n    *   Displaying stock information (name, price, company details).\n    *   Adding a placeholder for the historical price chart (we can implement a real chart later).\n    *   Implementing the \"buy/sell/accumulate\" recommendation display.\n3.  **Implement News & Indicators Section:** Decide where to display the news and indicators (either on the home screen or in the stock detail view). Then:\n    *   Create a component to fetch and display news articles and economic indicators.\n    *   Integrate this component into the chosen screen.\n\nAfter the coding agent implements the plan, the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` should be removed.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-06T16:25:48.527677"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build a Kenyan stock tracking app!
